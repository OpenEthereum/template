# Template

This is a template project to be used on new contract projects. You can generate a new project using
this template with [pi](https://github.com/vmchale/project-init).

Install pi:

```
rustup run nightly cargo install project_init
```

Create a new project:

```
pi git parity-contracts/template project-name
```

The generator will ask you for your name and email but these will be ignored when generating the project.
